## m0ukaPortfolio

This is my portfolio I made with NuxtJS and Tailwind. Pretty satisfied with the final result.
It uses VoidStudios.dev API in order to fetch the live stats, and updates every X seconds.
The content is rendered server-side (it uses SSR)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
